Followed tutorial found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47eXVRJKdkU
commented code to elaborate on what i learned, the functionality of things that were above and beyond what we already learned in hack reactor

i used liveserver vscode addon to be able to run without cors errors.
once installed you can right click anywhere on the body of your index.html and run live server to test
