Followed tutorial found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47eXVRJKdkU
commented code to elaborate on what i learned, the functionality of things that were above and beyond what we already learned in hack reactor

** i used liveserver vscode addon to be able to run without cors errors. **
** once installed you can right click anywhere on the body of your index.html and run live server to test **

new structures/functions in this project that i don't recall learning in mod1 or mod2, or were only briefly touched on:
1. use of data tags on html elements
2. use of variables ('--') in css elements
3. use of 'input.code' to determine keyboard input type
4. use of 'element.getBoundingClientRect' to outline a hitbox
5. use of {once: true} to make an event listener only operate once
6. use of 'window.requestAnimationFrame' to trigger a function on next available frame
7. use of window.innerHeight and Width to measure the browser dimensions
8. use of getComputedStyle and getPropertyValue to fetch elements and properties of those elements
9. use of elem.style.setProperty to add elements to our html
